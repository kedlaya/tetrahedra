### LINE CONFIGURATIONS ###
###########################

By running the Jupiter notebook "4-vector-configurations-1-parameter-families.ipynb" one can generate all possible intersections of
Kedlaya's algerbaic families of 1-parameter solutions to the Gram determinant equation and their images under the action of the group
G' with the "triangle inequalities" polytope P (defined via "dihedral angles" of the form \alpha_{ij} = \pi - \theta_{ij} rather than
the angles \theta_{ij} between normals). One has to do this for each of the 3 algebraic families.

By running the Jupiter notebook "4-vector-configurations-2-parameter-families.ipynb" one can do an analogous computation for Kedlaya's
algebraic family of 2-parameter solutions.

These computations are described in Section 9 of the manuscript. The notebook has hopefully enough comments to lead the reader through.

### TETRAHEDRA ###
##################

By running the Jupiter notebook "4-vector-configurations-tetrahedra.ipynb" one can find all possible geometric families of (non-degenerate)
tetrahedra produced from Kedlaya's algebraic family of 1-parameter (non-degenerate) solutions to the Gram determinant equation. The output
corresponds (up to S_4 symmetries) to the two 1-parameter families stated in Theorem 1.8 (see also Section 9 of the manuscript).
